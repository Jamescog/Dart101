# Dart101

Welcome to the Dart101 repository! This is where I'm documenting my journey of learning Dart programming language. Dart is a versatile language that can be used for web development, mobile app development, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Dart, here are some resources to get you started:

- [Dart Official Website](https://dart.dev/): The official Dart website has documentation, tutorials, and other useful information.

- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/): An online Dart editor that allows you to write and run Dart code in your browser.

- [Dart Documentation](https://dart.dev/guides): The official Dart documentation provides in-depth guides and reference material.

## Repository Structure

- `examples/`: This directory contains sample Dart code and projects that I'm working on as I learn Dart. Feel free to explore and use them as references.

- `resources/`: Here, I'll list any books, articles, or other learning materials I find useful while learning Dart.

- `notes/`: This is where I'll take notes on Dart concepts, best practices, and any other insights I gain during my learning process.

## Progress

I'll keep updating this section with my progress as I learn Dart. Check back here to see what I've learned and accomplished.

## Contributing

If you're also learning Dart and want to collaborate, feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with your own notes, code samples, or improvements to existing content. Let's learn Dart together!
